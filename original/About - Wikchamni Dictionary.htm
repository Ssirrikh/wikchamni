					<p>This dictionary began in 1969 with a request by Cecile Silva 
that I ‘write her history and language’ for her and the other Pohot 
sisters, Mary Friedrichs, Virginia Aguilar, and Susie Metcalf. She felt 
this was important because many of the younger folks showed little 
interest in learning and speaking their language and those that did were
 missing some of the subtleties that these sisters had learned from 
their parents Mary and Joe Pohot. She asked me to promise to make this 
information available to others and I agreed. Of course I didn’t realize
 it would take almost fifty years. Serious work on the project began in 
the summer of 1970 and continued over the following nine years. Cecile 
was the primary consultant with Mary and Virginia making valuable 
additions that can be seen and heard throughout this dictionary. 
Although all the sisters spoke English at home, Cecile, Mary and 
Virginia would carry out lengthy conversations in Wikchamni when they 
got together. Cecile took an active part in helping to preserve her 
language and culture as she patiently assisted me in the study of her 
language. Although these wonderful women have all passed away, the 
promise I made to Cecile in 1969 is now realized with this dictionary of
 the Wikchamni language.</p>
					<p>Because of many special characteristics of the Wikchamni (also 
spelled “Wukchumni” by some) language spoken by these women, including 
alveolar (retroflex) consonants and partially rounded central vowels I 
have tried to include audio examples of as many words and example 
sentences as possible. <!-- There are digital audio copies of all the material used in this dictionary plus a larger collection of stories, ethnographic descriptions and conversations that can be accessed at <span style="color: rgb(15, 163, 15); font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(Fresno State collection information here)</span>--></p>
					<p>I have included information for Yawelmani and Chukchansi, two 
languages that are related to Wikchamni, wherever possible. The 
Yawelmani data comes from an unpublished lexicon that is derived from 
the work of Stanley Newman. The Chukchansi material comes from an 
unpublished list derived from the work of Sylvia Broadbent and from a 
Chukchansi Dictionary by Niken Adisasmito-Smith (2016). The first two 
sources are unmarked in the Wikchamni Dictionary and the latter source 
is marked as (NAS).</p>
					<p>This work has been supported over the years by the <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/artshum/linguistics/">Linguistics Department</a> at California State University, Fresno, the <a href="https://cla.berkeley.edu/">Survey for California and Other Indian Languages</a> at the University of California, Berkeley, and the <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/anthropology">Anthropological Archives</a> at the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
					<p>I want to thank the large number of people who have continued to
 provide encouragement to complete this project; and a particular thanks
 to Mr. W. Flores, a grand nephew of the Pohot sisters, who helped renew
 my commitment to see the work done before I get too old to remember.</p>

					<p style="color: black;">The Fresno State campus sits in the midst 
of the San Joaquin Valley, a valley rich in the traditions and 
representation of Native American peoples and cultures. We are grateful 
to be in the traditional homelands of the Yokuts and Mono peoples, whose
 diverse tribal communities share stewardship over this land.</p>
